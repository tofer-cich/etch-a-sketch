# etch-a-sketch

## Welcome to my attempt at etch-a-sketch!

It isn't the prettiest site, but it demonstrates what I've learned thus far from the Odin Project!

New concepts include:

+ createElement()
+ querySelector()
+ Array.from()
+ insertBefore()
+ addEventListener()
+ appendChild()
+ children
    - remove()
+ arrow functions


I had a lot of fun doing this project and learned some neat stuff.
